            <h1>Hey there! I'm Yellin</h1>
            
            <p>I'm a problem solver who loves a good challenge. Outside of work and school, 
                I'm always looking for new ways to make myself better and explore this big, 
                amazing world. In the past, I've led the design team for a beginner-focused hackathon, 
                StarterHacks and volunteered several terms building tech for the good of society with UXPacer. 
                I’ve also volunteered in several countries , and did the fundraisers during COVID-19. 
                In my free time, I love to draw 🎨, baking cookies 🍪, and discovering new food with friends. 
                🍜 But most importantly, I'm always down for a chat!</p>
